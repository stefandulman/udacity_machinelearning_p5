# Udacity investment and trading capstone project

The project report is here:

* projectreport.pdf

The main code for the project is found in the python files:

* portfolio.py     - portfolio management functionality
* predictor.py     - prediction of future stock values functionality
* singlestock.py   - single stock management functionality
* visualizedata.py - preprocessing and data visualization functionality

For each of these files, examples of usage are included in the jupyter notebooks attached. All the results in the final report are generated with these files:

* portfoliomanagement.ipynb
* singlestockprediction.ipynb
* singlestock.ipynb
* visualizedata.ipynb

The data/ folder stores downloaded stock data from Yahoo finance. It needs to be present, even if empty. If a data set is found locally, it will be used. Otherwise data will be retrieved from Yahoo finance and stored here.
